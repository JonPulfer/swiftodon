## ActivityPub server
This is an [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#social-web-working-group) server that is capable of federating with 
services such as [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about). 

It is being built using the [Hummingbird](https://hummingbird.codes) v2 web framework and Swift 6. The intention is for it to have pluggable modules for 
infrastructure services such as object storage.
